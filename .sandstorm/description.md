**Paperwork is an open source self hosted note-taking & archiving app -- an alternative to Evernote, Microsoft OneNote & Google Keep.**

Paperwork allows you to create and manage notes to boost your productivity. Use it as a daily companion to keep track of your tasks or as a knowledge management system and archive. Share notebooks with others to collaborate with read & write access or create a knowledge base where others have read-only access.

This is a Sandstorm port of Paperwork based on [Twostairs Paperwork](http://paperwork.rocks/).
